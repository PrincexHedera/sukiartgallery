    <h2>The Gallery</h2>
    <p>Suki's Art Gallery is a showcase of feline creativity in a serene and imaginative setting. Suki's paw-painted
        masterpieces capture the essence of her artistic spirit, and her portfolio is always evolving to reflect her
        latest inspirations.</p>

    <h2>Art Commissions</h2>
    <p>Suki is currently not accepting commissions, as she prefers to lay on windowsills and yell at her roommates.
        However, if you happen to bribe her with a can of wet food, Suki's talents are at your service.</p>

        collection tells
